Pulsar is a small C# engine, his main purpose is to provide high extending/modding capabilities and an easy framework to work with.
It is part of [Ubercube](https://github.com/horizon-studio/ubercube) project, and will be developped along with.

The engine isn't mature for now, some docs will come in future.
WeI have no plan to make a full featured engine, it's just a framework for ur projects.
However you can use it for whatever you want as long as the licence is respected.
Pull request/issue/debate will be well received.

If your are searching for a C#/C++ engine take a look at [Flax Engine](https://github.com/FlaxEngine/FlaxAPI), it's definitly a great engine, give it a try.
